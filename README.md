# Medical Transformers

## Abstract

Transformers are a widely adopted technique in
the natural language processing research community due
to their powerful attention and parallelization capabilities.
However in the computer vision scene, before vision
transformer (ViT), pure applications of transformers on
images often are underperformed compared to convolutional
neural networks or hybrid models (CNNs and transformers
together). Vision transformer (ViT), although a relatively
new approach, has the state of the art results in image
classification. In this paper, we apply vision transformers
(ViT) to the medical domain for the first time. We also
propose a strided (SViT) approach that improves both vision
transformer (ViT) and vision transformer trained with
distillation tokens (DViT). Further analyses and comparisons
between different applications of vision transformers are given.
